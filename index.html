                            <p>Upgradation of the bank’s authentication mechanism to have multi-factor authentication. This means that a customer must authorize high risk transactions or user journeys using at least two authentication factors, for example, Username Password, Memorable Information, Call Challenge, SMS OTP etc. The technical architecture was micro service based with services being written in java using Spring boot.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Owner of the first microservice that went live in production for the project. Which means I was responsible for understanding requirements, developing them and doing everything necessary for making it go live. This involved communication across teams, solving performance related issues, production support, looking at prod issues. </li>
                                <li>The API needed to be called by different teams within the bank so, I took active part in that integration.</li>
                                <li>Developed common logging module for request tracing using Log4j. This involved building a common module for logging the request and response of any microservice within a journey. This greatly help in tracing a request through the platform. </li>
                                <li>Worked on Docker file for running software tool called OpenAM on development environment. This involved  building the image starting from a base image which was available at the bank’s registry then copying certain files, security certificates etc., which were specific to our project needs. Once the image was built we used docker compose for bringing the containers up.</li>
                                <li>Also worked on building other services in platform. These microservices were used to implement different authentication mechanisms like User Name and password, Memorable Info, Call Challenge, SMS OTP etc.</li>
                                <li>Participated in code review sessions.</li>

I was a part of Maintenance and Enhancement team which looked into defects reported in the application and enhancements to the existing functionality.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Did Development and enhancement work for client’s web application. This involved requirement gathering from client, careful analysis of requirements and coming up with approaches to implement through code.</li>
                                <li>Maintenance and Bug Fixing – This involved extensive debugging of existing code and strong analytical skills to work across technologies for a single bug fix or change request.</li>
                                <li>Testing – Was involved in Unit Testing, Test case documentation and peer code review.</li>
                                <li>Data Extracts – Often there were requirements from clients and team members to gather data for analysis or metrics.</li>
                                <li>Production support - Provided production support for the application I worked on. This required familiarity with entire application for quick response to end user’s queries.</li>
                                <li>Did R&D work on a proprietary tool of Goldman Sachs called CBP (Continuous Build Platform). This tool did a timely build (if there was a fresh check-in) of the code in CVS and sent an email if the build failed or passed.</li>
